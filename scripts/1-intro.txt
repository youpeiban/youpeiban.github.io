welcome to the first episode of the github learning course

my name is scott chacon, and in this episode were going to learn what git is - just a quick introduction before we start using it

Git is a fast, open source, distributed version control system that is quickly
replacing subversion in open source and corporate programming communities.

# version control system
git --version
git help

# open source

# snapshots, not changesets

# offline and fast

# small (vs svn)
du -d 1 -h

# cheap branching and easy merging

# git-scm.com
