description: Cheat sheets and quick references for Git and GitHub commands.

Today, we've launched the first _minimum viable product_ for GitHub open courseware and curriculum. We believe this is the right way, in our CEO's spirit of [open source almost everything](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2011/11/22/open-source-everything.html), to increase the ability for more events to teach Git and GitHub with an excellent curriculum.

Your contributions are very welcomed. We'd love to see many universities, high schools and other organizations forking and submitting pull requests to these materials.

We're excited to see where our curriculum goes, having created it in the open spirit of [Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org), [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com), [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org), and [MIT Open Courseware](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm).

Read more about our vision for these materials in [the README](https://github.com/github/teach.github.com/blob/gh-pages/README.md).
